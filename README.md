This is an pure objective-c (not Cocos2d) joystick implement.

There are three images.</br>
stick_base.png</br>
stick_normal.png</br>
stick_hold.png</br>

You can change them or add your new images for the joystick.

The size of the joystick in the demo is 128 * 128, so in the JoyStickView, I set the center point to (64, 64).

If your joystick has a different size, please modify it.
